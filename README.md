# PRODIGY_SD_02
This Java program challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within K attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback to help the user adjust their next guess.

If the guessed number is greater than the actual number, the program displays:
"Your guess is too high. Try again."

If the guessed number is less than the actual number, the program displays:
"Your guess is too low. Try again."

If the guessed number is correct, the program displays a congratulatory message and ends the game.

The game continues until the user either guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.
